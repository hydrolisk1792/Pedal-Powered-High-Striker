This contains code to be put on an ESP32 Development board and Arduino Mega board.  The boards communicate via UART with custom integers sent back and forth.  Mega stores all the menu data for game settings whilst ESP stores all the game graphics and logic.  NOTE:  This is an on going project for my job and is not to be used by others at this point.  When the project is done there may be an instructable to go along with this.  For now use at your own risk.  If there are any suggestions, please feel free to let me know of them.
